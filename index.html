          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            Hi, there I'm Ian. I refresh web pages, read documentation and
            occasionally even get to write code. I'm extremely excited to join a
            talented team of developers, so feel free to contact me.

          <p>
            I am experienced with React, Node, Express, PostreSQL, Sass, and
            Agile Development. I've created a number of full-stack web apps some
            of which you can see below, I'm extremely motivated and enjoy
            working on challenging problems and coming up with novel solutions.

            When Iâ€™m not doing any of that I like playing DND, baking and
            watching entirely too much Television.

          <h3>Spaced-Out</h3>
          <p>
            A flashcard app for people interested in learning Afrikaans, the
            site uses the spaced-repetition algorithm for learning to increase
            the rate of learning for users. I built the app because I noticed
            there were essentailly no similar services for the language in
            question and I was interested in the concepts behind
            spaced-repetition.
